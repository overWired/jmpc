JMPC is a Java-based client for [Music Player Daemon](https://www.musicpd.org/).

I am writing it because I built a Jukebox, originally based on a DOS PC running DWJukebox (dwjukebox . com) **Sorry**,
I decided to break the hyperlink to DWJukebox because my last visit to the site in December 2020 seems that they've
become the victim of malicious ads :-(, but a nearby lightning strike blew the PC, and I just don't have the energy to
find the old drivers and old hardware I'd need to rebuild it using that software, so I've decided to attempt to
replace the PC with a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) instead.

The idea is to run MPD on the Pi (because that's stupidly simple), and run a Java web-based front end to simulate the
Jukebox interface.  I hope to be able to also run the web application and a browser, all on the same Pi to drive the
Jukebox.  We'll see how it goes, and change things up as necessary.

If this works, I get the bonus of being able to remotely control the Jukebox with a smartphone, tablet, or computer, which just adds interesting options.
